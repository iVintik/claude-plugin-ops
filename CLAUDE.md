# plugin-ops — Development Guide

## Overview

Plugin lifecycle management for Claude Code plugins. Provides issue tracking, health audits, optimization with non-regression guarantees, fixing, releasing, and marketplace operations.

Complements Anthropic's `plugin-dev` plugin (which handles plugin creation, structure, skills, hooks, and MCP development) by adding operational lifecycle tooling on top.

## Design Principles

- **No hooks** — Operates on other plugin directories. No safety hooks needed.
- **No MCP server** — All functionality through skills (markdown workflows).
- **Non-regression** — optimize and fix skills read ISSUES.md to protect resolved fixes.
- **ISSUES.md over database** — Lightweight, version-controlled, readable without tools.
- **Provider-agnostic** — Works with GitHub, GitLab (including on-prem), and any git remote.
- **Generic** — No hardcoded paths, repos, or organization-specific references.

## Relationship to plugin-dev

This plugin does NOT duplicate Anthropic's `plugin-dev`. Use each for its strength:

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Create a new plugin | `/plugin-dev:create-plugin` |
| Learn skill/hook/MCP development | `/plugin-dev:*` skills |
| Validate plugin structure | `plugin-dev:plugin-validator` agent |
| Track issues across plugin lifetime | `/plugin-ops:issues` |
| Audit plugin health over time | `/plugin-ops:reflect` |
| Optimize with regression safety | `/plugin-ops:optimize` |
| Fix tracked issues safely | `/plugin-ops:fix` |
| Manage plugin marketplaces | `/plugin-ops:marketplace` |
| Release and publish versions | `/plugin-ops:release` |

## Adding Knowledge

Knowledge files are kept minimal. When adding:
1. Keep under 10 KB per file, 50 KB total
2. Use concrete examples, not generic docs
3. Don't duplicate what Anthropic's plugin-dev already covers
